1.	What are PropTypes used for? Please describe why it's important to type check our data in JavaScript?

**PropTypes is a dependency that can be used in Reactjs that gives you ways as a developer to check data that is passed as props.  It is important to check data to signal errors when a certain type of data is passed that shouldn’t.  You want to be able to check and make sure the correct type of data is being passed.**

2.	Describe a life-cycle event in React?

**A lifecycle event is basically certain methods that you can use during the life-cycle of a component.  These ‘events’ allow you to program certain actions during the birth and death of a component.  For example, as a component mounts (part the life-cycle is mounted) you can fire a method that will take action after mounting, but before rendering.**

3.	Explain the details of a Higher Order Component?

**A HOC is the same concept of a HOF.  The idea works in that you can create a function/component (high order) that can take other functions/components (as arguments) and then return another function/component.**  

4.	What are three different ways to style components in React? Explain some of the benefits of each?

* 1.	React-Strap.  Quick and generally used.  Not much of a learning curve – gets up beautiful layouts and design quickly. 
* 2.	Styled-components.  No need for CSS and all styling can be done in one file.  You can create custom styled components and use them throughout your app when needed. 
* 3.	Vanilla CSS.  Total control.  No need to fight with other styling when trying to customize.
